Impact on the System
--------------------

A large number of connections to ZooKeeper caused the ZooKeeper to be fully connected and unable to provide normal services.

Possible Causes
---------------

A large number of client processes are connected to ZooKeeper. The thresholds are not appropriate.

Procedure
---------

**Check whether there are a large number of client processes connected to ZooKeeper.**

#. On MRS Manager, choose **O&M** > **Alarm** > **Alarms**. On the displayed interface, click the drop-down button of **Available ZooKeeper Client Connections Are Insufficient**. Confirm the node IP address of the host for which the alarm is generated in the Location Information.

#. Open the ZooKeeper service interface, click **Resource** to enter the **Resource** page, and check whether the number of connections of the client with the IP address specified by **Number of Connections** **(By Client IP Address)** is large.

   -  If it is, go to :ref:`3 <alm-13007__li9739531132620>`.
   -  If it is not, go to :ref:`4 <alm-13007__li1373973122619>`.

#. .. _alm-13007__li9739531132620:

   Check whether connection leakage occurs on the client process.

#. .. _alm-13007__li1373973122619:

   Click |image1| in the **Number of Connections** **(by Client IP Address)** to enter the **Thresholds** page, and click **Modify** under **Operation**. Increase the threshold by referring to the value of **maxClientCnxns** by choosing **Cluster >** *Name of the desired cluster* **> Services** > **ZooKeeper** > **Configurations > All Configurations > quorumpeer**.

#. Check whether the alarm is cleared.

   -  If it is, no further action is required.
   -  If it is not, go to :ref:`6 <alm-13007__li27361331112613>`.

**Collect fault information.**

6. .. _alm-13007__li27361331112613:

   On the MRS Manager portal, choose **O&M** > **Log > Download**.

7. Select **ZooKeeper** in the required cluster from the **Service**.

8. Click |image2| in the upper right corner, and set **Start Date** and **End Date** for log collection to 10 minutes ahead of and after the alarm generation time, respectively. Then, click **Download**.

9. Contact the O&M personnel and send the collected logs.

Alarm Clearing
--------------

After the fault is rectified, the system automatically clears this alarm.
